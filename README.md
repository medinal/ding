Ding is a crowd-sourced educational exchange platform.  Users are able to create classes that others can enroll in.  The goal is to make the world a better place through educational and self-driven personal growth (yeah!).

##Installation

We have a lot of crazy dependencies, like stuff for oauth.  

Be sure to run npm install.

Also, be sure to exit the seed.js file once it runs (you'll see 'completed' printed to console multiple times, just press ctrl+c to exit).

##Usage: a haiku

First, choose a user.
Enroll or make a new class.
The buttons do things.

##Contributing

Fork it!

If you have features you think could be added, feel free to fork and play!

Features We'd Like To Add (But Couldn't Implement Yet...)
- Skillz List

- Course Date/Time

Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature
Commit your changes: git commit -am 'Add some feature'
Push to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature
Submit a pull request :D
